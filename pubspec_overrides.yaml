## IMPORTANT: Do NOT use this override when building/running on Android.
## If you run Android with this file present, login persistence will break.
## To keep Linux desktop dev working while Android uses the real plugin,
## we scope the override via platform-specific condition using flavors or
## by instructing developers to rename this file when building Android.
