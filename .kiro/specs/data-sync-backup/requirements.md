# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive data synchronization and backup system for DocLedger that maintains the offline-first approach while providing cloud backup and multi-device synchronization capabilities. The system will use local SQLite as the primary data store with Google Drive as the backup and synchronization medium, ensuring each clinic has their own isolated backup space while supporting multiple devices per clinic. This approach prioritizes performance and reliability while providing secure cloud backup and sync capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Data Storage Foundation

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want all my data stored locally on my device so that I can continue working even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a local SQLite database with all necessary tables for patients, visits, payments, and queue management
2. WHEN performing any data operation THEN the system SHALL prioritize local database operations to ensure immediate responsiveness
3. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally with full CRUD operations on local data
4. WHEN data is modified locally THEN the system SHALL track changes with timestamps and change flags for synchronization purposes

### Requirement 2: Google Drive Integration and Authentication

**User Story:** As a clinic administrator, I want to authenticate with Google Drive so that my clinic's data can be backed up to our own Google Drive account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up backup for the first time THEN the system SHALL prompt for Google Drive authentication using OAuth2
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store secure tokens for future backup operations
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them or prompt for re-authentication
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating in offline-only mode and notify the user
5. WHEN multiple Google accounts are available THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select the appropriate clinic account

### Requirement 3: Automated Cloud Backup

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want my data automatically backed up to Google Drive so that I don't lose important patient and financial information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN significant data changes occur THEN the system SHALL schedule a backup operation within 5 minutes
2. WHEN the device is connected to WiFi THEN the system SHALL prioritize backup operations to avoid mobile data usage
3. WHEN backup is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a discrete progress indicator without blocking user operations
4. WHEN backup completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the last backup timestamp and notify the user
5. IF backup fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff and log the error
6. WHEN the app is idle for more than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL perform a full backup if changes exist

### Requirement 4: Multi-Device Synchronization

**User Story:** As a clinic with multiple devices, I want changes made on one device to be synchronized to other devices so that all staff can see up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check for remote changes and download updates if available
2. WHEN remote changes are detected THEN the system SHALL merge them with local data using timestamp-based conflict resolution
3. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent change and log conflicts for review
4. WHEN synchronization is in progress THEN the system SHALL show sync status without blocking user operations
5. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL continue with local data and retry sync on next app launch
6. WHEN multiple devices modify the same record THEN the system SHALL use last-write-wins strategy with conflict logging

### Requirement 5: Data Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want the system to handle data conflicts intelligently when the same information is modified on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same record is modified on different devices THEN the system SHALL compare timestamps and apply the most recent change
2. WHEN critical conflicts occur (e.g., payment amounts) THEN the system SHALL create a conflict log for manual review
3. WHEN merging patient records THEN the system SHALL preserve all visit history and payment records from both sources
4. IF data integrity issues are detected THEN the system SHALL quarantine affected records and notify the administrator
5. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the system SHALL update all connected devices with the resolved data

### Requirement 6: Backup File Management

**User Story:** As a clinic administrator, I want my backup files organized and manageable in Google Drive so that I can understand and control my data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating backups THEN the system SHALL organize files in a dedicated "DocLedger_Backups" folder in Google Drive
2. WHEN storing backup files THEN the system SHALL use encrypted, compressed formats with clinic identifier in filename
3. WHEN backup files accumulate THEN the system SHALL maintain the last 30 daily backups and 12 monthly backups
4. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up older backup files beyond retention policy
5. WHEN backup files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to use the most recent valid backup for restoration

### Requirement 7: Data Restoration and Recovery

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want to restore my data from Google Drive backup in case of device failure or data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the app on a new device THEN the system SHALL offer to restore from Google Drive backup
2. WHEN restoration is requested THEN the system SHALL download and decrypt the most recent backup file
3. WHEN restoration is in progress THEN the system SHALL show detailed progress and prevent other operations
4. WHEN restoration completes THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and notify the user of success
5. IF restoration fails THEN the system SHALL provide options to try older backup files or start fresh
6. WHEN partial restoration occurs THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which data was recovered and what was lost

### Requirement 8: Offline-First Operation Guarantee

**User Story:** As a clinic user, I want the app to work perfectly even when internet is unavailable so that patient care is never interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue all core operations without any functional limitations
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically queue and execute pending sync operations
3. WHEN operating offline for extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality for at least 30 days
4. WHEN sync operations fail THEN the system SHALL never block or degrade local operations
5. WHEN storage space is low THEN the system SHALL prioritize local operations over sync data storage

### Requirement 9: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a clinic handling sensitive patient data, I want all backup and sync operations to be secure and compliant with privacy requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data using AES-256 encryption before uploading
2. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure device storage mechanisms
3. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS/TLS for all communications with Google Drive
4. WHEN handling patient data THEN the system SHALL ensure no personally identifiable information is stored in plain text in backups
5. WHEN sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity using checksums and digital signatures

### Requirement 10: User Control and Transparency

**User Story:** As a clinic administrator, I want full control over backup and sync settings so that I can manage the system according to our clinic's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to enable/disable automatic backup and sync
2. WHEN viewing sync status THEN the system SHALL show last backup time, sync status, and any pending operations
3. WHEN managing storage THEN the system SHALL display backup file sizes and Google Drive usage statistics
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of backup and sync operations
5. WHEN privacy is a concern THEN the system SHALL allow users to perform manual backups only and disable automatic sync
